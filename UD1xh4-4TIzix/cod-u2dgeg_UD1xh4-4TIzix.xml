      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>aslured beleefe of the minde, whose onely stay 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>is upon God and his word  
      <!--30.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="30"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>N my last sermon 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>I declared unto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>you, how that the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>perfect exposition of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/> Gods worde doth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>differ nothing from 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>AdocFbye rule of true faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>and the love of God and our neigh 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>bour. For undoubtedly, that sense of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>Scripture is corrupted, which doth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>square from faith, and the two poynts  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>of charitie. I have nowe therefore next 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>to treat of true faith and charitie to 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>wards God and our neighbour, to the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>intent that no man may finde lacke of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>any thing heerein. 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>And first therefore by Gods helpe, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>the good meanes of your prayers, I wil  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>speake of true faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>This word Faith or beleefe, is di 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>versly used in the common talk of me 
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>For it is taken for any kinde of Reli 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>gion or honour done to God. As we say 
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>the Christian faith, the lewish faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>and the Furkish faith. Faith or beleefe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>also, is taken for a conceived opinion of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>any thing that is told us, as when we  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>heare any thing rehearsed unto us out  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>of the Indian or Ethiopian hystorie,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>we by and by say that wee beleeve it,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>and yet notwithstanding wee put no  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>confidence in it nor hope to have any  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>commoditie thereby at all. This is that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>faith, wherewith saint James sayeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>that the Devil beleeveth ec trembleth. 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>Last of all, faith is commonly put for  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>an allured and undoubted confidence  
      <!--30.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="30"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="c"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>in God and his word. Among the He 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>brues faith taketh her name of truth,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>certeintie and allured constancie. The  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>Latines call that faith, when that is,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>done which is said. Whereuppon one  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>saith, I demaunde of thee whether 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>thou beleevest or no? Thou aunswe 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>rest, I beleeve: Doe then that which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>thou saiest, and it is faith. Therefore in :  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>this treatise of ours, Faith is an un 
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>doubted beleefe, most firmely groun 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>ded in the minde. This faith, which is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>a settled and undoubted perswasion or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>beleefe leaning upon God &amp; his word,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>is diversly defined by ye perfecter Di 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>vines. S. Paul saith, Faith is the sub 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>stance of thinges hoped for, the evi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>dence of thinges not seene. The sub 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>stance or hypostasis is the foundation.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>or the unmoveable prop, which uphol 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>deth us, &amp; wheron we leane &amp; lye with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>out peril or danger. The things hoped  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>for, are thinges celestiall, eternall, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>inuisible. And therefore Paul sayeth.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>Faith is an unmoveable foundation,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>and a most allured confidence of gods 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>promises, that is, of life everlasting and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>all his good benefits. Moreover Paul  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>himelfe, making an erposition of that  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>which he had spoken, immediately af,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>ter, saith: Faith is the argument of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>thinges not seene. An argument or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>proofe is an evident demoustration,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>wherby we manifestly prove ye, which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>otherwise should he doubtful, so that in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>him whom we undertooke to instruct,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>there may remaine no doubt at all,  
      <!--31.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="31"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>But now touthing ye mysteries of god 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>revealed in Gods word, in theselves  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>or in their owne nature they can not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>be seene with bodilie eyes : and there 
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>fore are called thinges not seene. But,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>this faith by giving light to the minde,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>dooth in heart perceive them, even as  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>they are set foorth in the word of God.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>Faith therefore according to the de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>sinition of Paul, is in the minde a most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>evident saying, and in the heart a most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>certaine perceiving of thinges inuisi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>ble, that is, of thinges eternall, of God 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>I say and all those thinges which hee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>in his word setteth forth unto us con 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>cerning spirituall thinges. To this de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>finition of Paules they had an eye,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>which defined Faith in this forte.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>Faith is a grounded persuasion of hea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>venly thinges, in the meditation wher 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>of wee ought so to oecupie our selves 
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>for the allured truthes sake of Gods 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>worde, thatwe may beleeve that in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>minde we doe see those things as well  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>as with our eyes we do behold things 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>sensibly perceived, Zc easie to be seene, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>This description doth not greatly dif 
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>fer from this definition of an other 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>godly &amp; learned man who saith: Faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>is a fledfast perswasion of the minde, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>whereby we doe fully decree with our  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>selves that gods truth is so sure, that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>he can neither will nor choose but 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>performe that which he in his worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>hath promised to fulsill. Againe, Faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>is a stedfast allurednesse of conscience,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>which dooth imbrace Christ in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>same fort, wherein he is offered unto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>us by the Gospell. Another there is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>which after the same manner almost  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>defineth faith in this forte: Faith is a  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>gift inspired by God into the mind of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>man, wherby without any doubting at  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>all he doth beleeve that to bee most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>true what so ever God hath either  
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>taught or promised in the bookes of  
      <!--31.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="31"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>both the Testaments. The very same  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>author of this definition therfore doth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>ertend faith to three termes of time, to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>the time past, the time present, and the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>time to come: For he teacheth to be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>lieve that the world was made by god,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>and whatsoever the holy Scriptures  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>doe declare to have beene done in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>olde world: also that Christ dying for  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>us, is the only salvation of them which I 
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>believe: and that by the same God at  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>this day also, the world and Church  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>are governed or preserved, aud that in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>Christ the faithfull are saved : last of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>all, that that shall most alluredly light  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>upon the ungodly and ye godly, whatso 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>ever the holy Scriptures doe either  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>threaten or promise,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>Out of all these definitions therfore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>being diligently considered, wee maye  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>according to ye Scriptures make this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>description of faith. Faith is a gift of 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>God, powred into man from heaven,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>whereby he is taught with an undou 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>ted perswasion, wholie to leane to 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>God and his worde, in which worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>God doth freely promise life and all 
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>good thinges in Christ, and wherein 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>all truth necessarie to be beleeved, is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>plainly declared. Which description 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>of faith, I will by Gods helpe in this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>that followeth unfolde into parts, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>by assertion of places out of the Scrip 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>tures, will both confirme and make  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>manifest unto you, Pee, as hitherto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>ye have done, so stil give diligent eare,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>and in your heartes pray earnestly to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>God.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>Frst of al, the cause or beginning of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>faith commeth not of any man, or any  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>strength of man, but of God himelfe,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>who by his holy spirite, inspireth faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>into our heartes. For in the Gospell  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>the Lord saith, No man commeth to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>me, unlesse my father draw him 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>And againe, Fleshe and bloude  
      <!--32.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="32"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>ssaith the Lord to Peter, confessinge  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>Christ in true faith) hath not revealed  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>this to thee, but my father which is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>in heaven. Whereunto the Apostle  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Paul alludeth when he sayth, we are  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>not able of our selves to thinke any 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>thing as of our selves, but all our abili 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>tie is of God. And in an other place, To  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>you it is given for Chrisl, not onely to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>beleeve in him, but also to suffer for  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>his sake. Faith therefore is powred in 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>to our hearts by God, who is the wel 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>spring and cause of all goodnesse,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>And yet we have to consider heere,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>that God in giving &amp; inspiring faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>dooth not use his absolute polver, or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>miracles in working, but a certaine  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ordinarie meanes agreeable to mans  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>capacitie: although he can in deede give 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>faith without those meanes, to whom,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>when, and how it pleaseth him? But  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>we read, that the Lord hath used this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>ordinarie meanes, even from the first  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>creation of all things. Whom he mea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>neth to bestowe knowledge and fayth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>on: to them he sendeth teachers, by the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>word of God to preach true faith unto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>them. Not because it lieth in mans 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>polver, wil, or ministerie, to give faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>nor because the outward word spoken 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>by mans mouth, is able of it selfe to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>bring faith: but the voyce of man, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>the preaching of Gods word, doo teach  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>us what true faith is, or what God 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>dooth wil and commaund us to believe.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>For God himselfe alone by sending his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>holy spirite into the hearts and minds 
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>of men, dooth open our heartes, per 
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>swade our mindes, and cause us with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>all our heart to believe that, which we  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>by his word and teaching have learned  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>to believe.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>The Lord coulde by miracle from  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>heaven, without any preaching at all,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>have bestowed faith in Christ upon 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>Cornelius the Centurion at Cesaria: 
      <!--32.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="32"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>but yet by an Angel he dooth send him 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>to the preaching of Peter. And while.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>Peter preacheth, God by his holy spis 
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>rite worketh in the heart of Corneli 
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>us, causing him to believe his prea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>thing. Verily S. Paule saith, Now  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>shall they beleeve in him of whome  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>they have not heard: Now shall they  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>heare without a preacher: And howe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>shall they preach if they bee not sent:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>So then, faith commeth by hearing, E 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>hearing by the word of God. In ano 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>ther place also. who is Paule saith he,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>or what is Apollos, but Ministers, by,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>whom ye have beleeved, according as  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>God hath given to everie one) I have,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>planted, Apollos watered, but God 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>hath given increase.  So then hee that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>lanteth is nothing, nor hee that wa 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>treth, but God that giveth increase,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>With this doctrine of saint Peter and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Saint Paule dooth that agree which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>Augustine writeth in the Preface of

      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>learne at mans hand without disdaine,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>And let us not goe about to tempt  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>him in whome wee beleeve, neither 
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>being deceived let us thinke scorne

      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>what he ought to believe, what to hope  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>for and what to love: all which things  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>notwithstanding might have been done  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>by the Angell, tc. The same Augu 
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>stine also in his Epistle to the Circen 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>ses saith: Even he worketh conversi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>on and bringeth it to passe, who by 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>his ministers doth warne us outward 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>ly with the signes of thinges, but in 
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>wardly doth by himelfe teach us with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>the verie thinges theselves. Also in his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>treatise upon the 26. of Iohn: what 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>doe men (saith he) when they preach  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>outwardly: what doe I nowe while I 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>speake) I drive into your eares a noise  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>of wordes: but unlesse he which is with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>in doe reveale it, what say l, or what 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>speake Iy he that is without doth hus 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>bande the tree, but hee within is the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>creator of it. ete. This said he, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>But, even as the Lorde his desire is,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>to have us believe his worde, dfor the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>Prophet cryeth out and saith: To day 
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>if yee will heare his voice, harden not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>your harts: ) So in like maner, he doth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>require of us al which heare his word,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>that we be not slacke in praying. For  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>in hearing the worde of God, we must  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>pray for the gift of faith, that the Lord  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>may open our harts, covert our soules,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>breake and beate downe the hardnesse  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>of our mindes, and increase the mea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>sure of faith bestowed uppon us. Of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>this order of prayer, there are many  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>examples in the holy scriptures. Whe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>the Lorde in the Gospell sayde to one,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>Canst thou beleeve) to him that belee 
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>veth all thinges are possible: He made  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>answere saying: I beleeve Lord, helpe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>thon mine unbeliefe. The Apostles  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>also cry to the Lord and say: O Lorde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>increase our faith. Moreover, this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>prayer, wherin we desire to have faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>powred into us, is of the grace and gift  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>of GOD, and not of our owne righte 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>ousnesse, which before God is none at

      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>all. This therefore is lefte unto us,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>for a thing most certaine and undoub 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>tedly true, that true faith is the meere 
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>gift of God, which is by the holy ghost  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>from heaven, bestowed uppon our 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>mindes, and is declared unto us in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>worde of trueth, by teachers sent of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>God, and is obtained by earnest prai 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>ers which cannot be tyred. Whereby  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>we learne that wee ought often and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>attentively to heare the word of God,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>and never cease to pray to God for the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>obtaining of true faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>But that this faith inspired from  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>heaven, and learned out of the worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>of trueth, doeth put into mans minde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>an undoubted perswasion, that is, that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>whatsoever we believe in the worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>of God, we doe believe it most allured 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>ly without wavering or doubting, be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>ing altogether as sure to have the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>thing, as faith doth believe to have it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>for I use this worde perswasion, not  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>as it is comonly taken, but for a firme  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>assent of minde inspired and perswa 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>ded by the holy ghost) that this faith a  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>saye, doth put into mans minde this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>undoubted perswasion, I meane to de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>clare by the example of Abrahams  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>faith, which Paule in the fourth chap 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>ter to the Romanes describeth in these  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>wordes. Abraham contrarie to hope  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>beleeved in hope: and he fainted not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>in faith, neyther considered hee his 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>owne body now dead, when he was al 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>most an hundred yeares olde, nor the 
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>deadnesse of saraes wombe, he stac 
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>kered not at the promise of God tho 
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>rowe unbeliefe, but became strong in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>faith and gave the glorie to God, ha 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>vinge a sure perswasion that hee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>which had promised, was able also to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>performe. In these wordes of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>Apostle, there are certaine notes to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>be obserued, which do prove to us that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>Faith doth bring an allured perswa

      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>ring, but laying hold upon the promised  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>worde of truth, getteth up againe by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>strugling, and is confirmed. So wee 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>reade, that at the promise of God, this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>came into Abrahams minde. What,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>shall there a Sonne bee borne to thee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>that art an hunored yeares olde: This  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>was that infirmitie, and stackering or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>weaknes of faith. But here thr Apostle  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>commending Abrahams faith, which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>overcame and yeelded not, teaching us  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>also of what fort true faith ought to be,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>that is, a firme and most allured per 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>swasion, saith: Abraham fainted not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>in faith, neither considered his owne  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>bodie dead, when hee was almost an  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>hundred yeares olde, nor the dead 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>nesse of saraes wombe. Loe, this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>thought came into Abrahams minde.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Shal a sonne be borne to mee that am  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>an hunored yeares old: But he fainted  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>not in faith. The faith of Abraham be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>gan not to droope by reason of this tep 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>tation.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>For, he considered not the weaknes  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>that was in himself, nothing answera 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>ble to the promise of God. What then 
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>He stackered not at the promise of God 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>through unbeliefe. That is, he gave no 
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>place to unbeliefe to be tempted of it:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>he fell not to his owne reasons and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>doubtfull inquisitions, as unbelievers  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>are wont to doe For Gods promise  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>being once set before the eyes of his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>mind, so that I say he stucke unmove 
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>ably, casting off all doubts and reasons  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>of his owne. For, faith hath no re 
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>spect at all to the weakenesse, mise 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>rie, or lacke which is properly in man 
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>kinde, but setteth her whole staye in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>the polver of God. So then, I saye,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>Abraham was strong in faith, that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>is, he prevayled and gotte the upper 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>hande in his temptation. For, this  
      <!--34.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="34"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>sion into the minde and heart of man 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>and so, that Faith is an undoubted co 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>fidence of things beleeved, whereto the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>heart is made privie, that is, that true  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Faith doeth not flye too and fro from 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>place to place in the heart of man, but 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>that beeing deepely rooted in Christ, it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>sticketh in the hart which is enlighte 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>ned.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>First, saieth the Apostle, Abraham 
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>contrarie to hope, beleeved in hope:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>that is to say, there he had a constant  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>hope, where notwithstanding hee had 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>nothing to hope after, if all things had 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>beene weighed according to the maner 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>of this worlde. But Hope is a most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>firm and undoubted looking after those  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>thinges which we believe: So that we  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>see that the Apostle did make faith ma 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>nifest by hope, and by the certaine 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>tie of hope, did declare the allured con 
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>stancie of faith. After that saith he,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>Abraham fainted not in faith, nor 
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>stackered at the promise of God tho 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>rouoh unbeliefe, but was stronge in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>faith.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>Ther are two kinds of ftackerings  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>in mankinde: The one is that which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>being overcome by evill temptations,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>doth bende to desperation, and the de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>spising of Gods promises. Such was 
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>the stackering of those ten spies of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>holy lande, of whom mention is made  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>in the thirteen and fourteene chapter of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>Numbers.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>The other stackering, is rather to be  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>called a weak infirmity of faith, which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>also is tempted it selfe : that nowe I  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>may not make rehearsall to you, how  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>that in us all by the spot of originall  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>sin, is naturally grafted a certain kind  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>of unbeliefe, and that mans minde is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>at no time so inlightened or confir 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>med, but that cloudie mystes of igno 
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>raunce and doubtinges doe sometimes  
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>arise: yet notwithstanding, faith yeel 
      <!--35.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="35"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>is an argument to shewe that hee had 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>the upper hande: He fainted not, nor 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>wated meake in faith. It followeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>in the Apostle, Abraham gave GO) 
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>the glorie, to witte, in beleeving that  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>GOD wisheth well to mankinde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>and that hee is a true God and almigh 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>tie.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>For he giveth God his glory, which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>attributeth to God the properties of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>God, &amp; doth not gainsay the word and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>promise of God. For John the Apostle  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>saith: Te that beleeveth not in God, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>maketh God a lyar, Abraham there 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>fore beleeved in God, and in belee 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>ving gave God the glorie. The Apo 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>stle Paul goeth forwarde and saieth,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>Hee was throughly perswaded, or cer 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>tified, that hee which had promised  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>was alble also to performe, Paul u 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>sed the Ereeke woorde mwe durnseie,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>which is all one as if you should saye,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>beeing certified. For, wwerderis doeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>signifie fully to certifie : whereupon 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>Thnes tris is an allured faith given un 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>to us which is made by waye of ar 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>gnment, or by the thing it selfe.  And  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>they call that :wnreemus, which we call  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>a certification, as when a thing by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>perswasiss is so beate into our minds,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>that after that we never doubt anye  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>more.,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Therefore faith did certifie Abraham, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>and with undoubted perswasions did  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>bring him to the point never to doubt,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>but that GODwas able to performe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>what he had promised, in faith therfore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>he stuck unmoveable to the promise of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>God, being alluredly certified that hee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>should obtaine whatsoever God had 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>promised.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>It is certaine therefore and plain 
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>ly declared by the woordes of hte Apo 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>stle, that true Fayth is an undoubted  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>perswasion in the minde of the belee

      <pb ed="#L" n="35"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>ver : even so to have the thing as his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>beleefe is, and as he is saide to have it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>in the expresse worde of God. There 
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>by also we learne, that faith is not the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>unstable and unaduised confidence of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>him which believeth every greate and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>unpossible thing. For, faith is ruled &amp; 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>bound to the word of God, to the word  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>of God, I say, rightly and truly under 
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>stoode,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>The godly and faithfull therefore,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>doe not by and by, out of the omnipo 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>tencie of God, gather what they list,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>as though God therfore would do eve 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>ry thing beeause he ean do all thinges,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>or that faith should therefore believe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>every thing, because it is written: All  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>thinges are possible to him that belee 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>veth. For, his faith is therefore a  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>greate deale more, because that which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>hee doth beleeve, is so set downe and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>declared in the word of God, as he do 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>eth believe.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>Furthermore, where the Lorde in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>the Gospel saith. All thinges are pos 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>sible to him that beleeveth, wee must  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>not take that saying to bee absolutely  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>spoken, but to be ioyned to the worde,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>will, and glory of God, &amp; the safetie of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>our soules. For, all thinges which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>GOD in his worde hath promised)  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>all thinges whiche GOD. will 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>have, and lastly, all thinges which I 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>make to the glorie of God, &amp; the fafe 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>garde of our soules, are possible to him 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>that beleeveth. And for that cause,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>the Apostle both openly and plainely  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>saide: whatsoever God hath promi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>sed, that same hee is, able also to 
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>performe. For whatsoever he hath not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>promised, &amp;: whatsoever pleaseth not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>his divine maiesty, or is contrarie to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>the will and expresse worde of God,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>that cannot GOD doe, not because  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>hee can not, but because he will not.

      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>God could make bread of stones, but 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>wee must not therefore believe that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>stones are bread, neyther are they  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>bread therefore, because God can doe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>all thinges. This yee shall understand  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>better and more fully, whereas a litle  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>hereafter I shall shew unto you, that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>true faith strayeth not nor wavereth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>wandring too and fro, but cleaveth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>close and sticketh fast to God and his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>worde,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>In the meane season because wee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>have shewed out of Paules wordes by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>the example af Abraham, that faith is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>a substance and undoubted perswasi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>on in the hearte. And because many 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>doe stifly stande in it, that man is not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>surely certeine of his salvation, I will  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>adde a fewe examples out of the Go 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>spell, whereby they may plainely per 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>ceive that faith is a more sure ground,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>and setled opinion touthing God and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>our salvation. And sirst verily the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>Centurion, of whom mention is made  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>in the Gospel, had conceived a stedfast  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>hope that his seruant should be healed  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>of the Lorde. For he understoode howe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>greate and mightie thinges hee promi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>sed to them that believe. Hee gathered 
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>also by the woorkes of Christ, that it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>was an easie matter for him to restore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>his seruant to health againe. There 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>fore hee commeth to the Lorde, and a 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>mong other talke sayeth. It is no rea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>Ion that thou shouldest come under 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>my roofe, yea doe but saie the worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>and my seruaunt shall be made whole.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>These wordes doe testifie, that in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>hearte and minde of the Centurion,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>there was a sure perswasion of most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>alssured health, which by a certeyne  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>comparison, hee doeth make manifest  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>and more fully expresse. For I my 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>selfe am a man under the authoritie of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>an other, and undermee I have soul 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>diours, and Isay to one, goe, and he

      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>goeth: and to an other, eome, and hee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>commeth: and to my seruant doe this,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>and he doeth it. Then the Lorde per 
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>ceived this certificatio of his mind, by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>his words most full of faith, he crieth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>out, that in al Israel he hath not found  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>so great faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>The same again in the Gospel, spea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>keth notably of ye womas faith which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>was sorely plagved with the bloudye  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>flure. And that faith was an undoub 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>ted perswasion in her hearte once illu 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>minated, we may thereby understand,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>because she (being first in deede stirred  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>up by the works &amp; words of the Lord)  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>thought thus within her selfe, if Idoe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>but touch his garment, I shalbe whole.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>And therforepressing through the thic 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>kest of the throng, cometh to the Lord,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>But why heape I together many ex 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>amples: doth not the onely faith of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Chananitish or Syrophenissian wo 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>man, declare more plainly than that it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>can be denied, how that faith is a most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>allured perswasion of things believed:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>For being over passed, and as it were  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>contemned of the Lord, shee wavereth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>not in faith, but following him, &amp; hea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>ring also that the Lord was sent to the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>lost sheepe of the house of Israel, shee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>goeth on to woorship him. Moreover,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>being put backe, &amp; as it were touched  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>with the foule reproch of a dogge, shee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>goeth forwarde yet humbly to cast her  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>selfe prostrate before the Lorde, reque 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>sting to obtaine the thing that she desi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>red. She would not have persevered so  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>stiffely if faith had not beene a certifi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>cation in her beleving mind and heart,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>Wherefore, the Lord moved with that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>faith of hirs, cryed: woman, great is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>thy faith, bee it done to thee even as  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>thou wilt.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>It is manifest therefore, by all these  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>testimonies of the holy Scripture, that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>faith is a stedfast &amp; undouted persuasio  
      <!--37.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="37"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>in the minde and heart of the believer,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>This, being now brought to an end,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>let us see what it is whereupon mans  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>faith doth leane, and also how we may 
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>clearely perceive, that faith is not a  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>vayne and unstalbe opinion cas a litle  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>before wee were about to saye) of any  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>thinge whatsoever conceived in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>minde of man, but that it is tyed by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>and contayned within bounds, and as  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>it were certaine conditions. In the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>definition therefore of faith, we sayde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>that faith bendeth to Godwarde, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>leaneth on his worde. God therefore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>and the worde of God, is the obiect  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>2. 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>or foundation of true faith. The thing 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>whereon a man may leane safely, sure 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>ly, and without all manner doubting,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>must needes be stedfast and altogether 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>unmoveable, which doeth give health,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>which doth preserue, and which doth sil  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>up or minister all fulnes unto us.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>For this doth faith seeke and request,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>But this is not else where tha in God.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>On God, alone therefore doeth true  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>faith bende and leane. God is everla 
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>sting, chifely good, wise, iust, mightie  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>and true of worde. And that doeth he  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>testifie by his workes and word,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>Wherefore in the Prophets he is cal 
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>led a strong and unmoveable Rocke,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>a castle, a wall, a tower, an inuincible  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>fortresse, a trealure, &amp; a wel that never 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>will be drawen drie. This everlasting  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>GOD can do all thinges, knoweth all  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>thinges, is present in all places, loveth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>mankind exceedingly, doth provide for  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>al men, and also governeth or disposeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>al things. Faith therefore, which is a  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>confidence of Gods good will and of his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>aide in al necessities, &amp; of the true sal 
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>vation of mantinde, bendeth on god a 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>lone, &amp; cannot leane to any other crea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>ture, in whom the things are not that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>faith requireth,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>And even as God is true of word, &amp;

      <pb ed="#L" n="37"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>can not lye, so is his word true and de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>ceiveth no man. In the worde of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>God is expressed the will and minde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>of God: To the word of God therefore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>hath faith an eye, &amp; layeth her ground  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>uppon Gods worde, touching which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>worde the Lorde in the Gospell sayde:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>Heaven and earth shall passe, but my 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>worde shall not passe.  The worde of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>God here is compared with the most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>excellent elementes. Ayre and Wa 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>ter are feeble and unstable Clements:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>but Heaven, although it turne and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>mone, doth keepe yet awonderfull and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>most stedfast course in mouing, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>stedfast are all thinges therein. The  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>Earth is most stable and unmovea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ble. Therefore it it be easier for these  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>thinges to be loased, which cannot be  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>undone, than for the worde of God to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>passe: it followeth that Gods word in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>al pointes is most stable, unmonea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>ble, and not possible to be loased. I  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>saith the Lorde in Jeremie) yee can 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>undoe the leagve that I have taken 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>with the day, or the covenant that l 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>have made with the night, so that it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>neyther be day nor night at the ap 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>pointed time, then may my covenant  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>be of nene effect which I have made 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>with Daind. But not the whole  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>worlde laying all their strengthes to 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>gether, is able to make it day when it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>is once night, nor cause the day to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>breake one houre sooner than the course  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>of heaven doth commaunde. There 
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>fore not all this worlde with all the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>polver and pompe thereof, shall be able  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>once to weaken or breake, to chaunge  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>or abolish so much as one tittle in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>worde of God, and the trueth of gods  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>worde. Faith therefore, which re 
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>steth upon a thing most firme or sure,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>cannot choose but bee an undoubted  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>certification. And since Gods worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>is the foundation of Faith, Faith can 
      <!--38.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="38"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>not wander to and fro, and leane to e 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>verie worde whatsoever. For every o 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>pinion conceived without the worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>of God, or against Gods worde, cannot  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>be called true faith. And for that cause  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>S. Paule the Apostle of Christ would  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>not ground the true or Christian faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>uppon any carnall proppes or opinions  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>of men, but upon the truth and polver  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>of God. With his wordes will I con 
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>clude this place. Faith (saith he) com 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>meth of hearing, and hearing by the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>worde of God. By the worde of God,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>he saith, and not by the word of man,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>Againe to the Corinthians: Ay  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>preaching (sayth he) was not in enti 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>sing wordes of mans wisedome, but in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>the shewing foorth of the spirite, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>of polver, that your faith shoulde not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>be in the wisedome of man, but in the 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>polver of God. Thereby also wee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>learne, that some there are, which a 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>gainst all reason require faith at our  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>handes, that is, they would have us to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>believe that, which they are not able  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>to shewe out of Gods worde, or that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>which is cleane contrarie to the word  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>of GOD. To the better declaring of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>this that I have saide, avayleth that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>short abridgement of Gods worde and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>of faith, which we in the definition of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>faith have closely knit up together 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Ther are there rehearsed two chiefe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>pointes of faith and of the worde. And  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>first of all that God in Christ doth free 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>ly promise life and every good thing.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>For God, who is the obiect or marke  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>and foundation of faith, being of his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>owne proper nature everliving ever 
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>lasting, &amp; good, doth of himself from be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>ifore all beginning, beget the son like to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>himselfe in al points, who because he is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>of the same substance with the father, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>is himselfe also by nature life and all  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>goodnesse.  And to the ende he might 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>communicate to us, his Sonnes and  
      <!--38.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="38"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>brethren, both life and all goodnesse, he  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>became man, and being conversant be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>rie God and man among men, he testi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>fied that God the Father, through the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Sonne, doeth polvre himselfe wholy  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>with all good thinges into the faithtul,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>whom hee quickneth and silleth with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>all goodnesse, and last of all doth take  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>them uppe to himelfe into the bles 
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>sed place of everlasting life.  And that  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>hee doth frankly and freely bestow this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>benefite, to the ende that the glorie of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>his grace may in all thinges be pray 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>sed. This doth true faith believe, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>hereunto belong no small parte of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>Scriptures, which testifie that God in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>Christ doth communicate to the faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>full, life and godlines. John the Apo 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>stle cryeth out and saith: In the be

      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>wish to the faithful the increase of the

      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>prayed, saying: G God create a cleane  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>heart within mee, and take not thy  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>holy spirite from mee. For hee had

      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>succeeded in the kingdome, the good spi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>rite of God was departed, and that in

      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>from true faith: Verily Paul to the

      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>nestly day and night to see yousper 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>sonally, and to supply that which is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>wanting in your taith. And a little  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>before, he said: For this cause I sent F 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>motheus, that I might be certified of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>your faith, least by any meanes the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>tempter had tempted you, and so our  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>Jabour had beene of no effect. The  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>same Apostle also in his Epistle to the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>Ephesians saith: Christ gave some  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>Apostles, some Prophets, some Pa 
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>stours ft teachers to the restoring of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>the saintes unto the building of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>body of Christ, untill we all meete to 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>gether in the unitie of faith, and the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>acknowledging of the sonne of God, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>unto a perfect man, unto the measure 
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>of age of the fulnesse of Christ, so that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>now we be no longer children: Ther 
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>fore so long as we live, we learne that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>our faith may not be perfect, &amp; if so be  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>at any time it shall bee weakened by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>temptations, that then it may bee re 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>paired, and againe confirmed. And  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>in this diversitie(I meane) in this in 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>crease and weakenesse of faith, there  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>is no partition or division, for the felfe

      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>wayes remaine, although it bee at  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>some time more, &amp; at sometime lesse,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>In like manner, faith is not therefore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>changed or cut in sunder, because one  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>is called generall faith, and another 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>particular faith. For generall faith is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>no other than that, which believeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>that al the words of God are true, and  
      <!--41.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="41"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>that God hath a good will to mankind.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>Particular faith believeth nothing  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>contrarie to this, onely that which is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>common to all, the faithfull applyeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>particularly to himself, helieving that  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>God is not well minded towarde o 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>thers alone, but even unto him also. 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>So then, it bringeth the whole into  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>partes, and that which is generall in 
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>to particularities. For whereas by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>generall faith he believeth that all the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>wordes of God are true: in the same  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>fort by particular faith he doth believe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>that the foule is immortall, that our  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>bodies rise againe, that the faithfull  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>shalbe saved, the unbelivers destroied,

      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>taught to bee believed in the worde of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>God. Moreover, the disputation tou

      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>True faith is obteined by no stregth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>or merite of man, but is poured ints  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>him of God, as I declared in my last  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>Sermon: and though man obtaine it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>by harkning unto the word of God, yet  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>neverthelesse, it is wholy imputed to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>ye grace of god. For unlesse this grace  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>do worke in wardly in the heart of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>hearer, ye preacher that laboureth outs  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>wardly doth bring no profit at all. We  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>reade in the third chapter of S. Augu 
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>stines booke, De preedestinatione Sanfto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>rum. That once he was in an error be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>cause hee thought that that faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>wherewith wee believe in God, is not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>the gift of God, but that it was in us as  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>of out selves, et that by it wee doe ob 
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>tein the gifts of God, wherby we may 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>in this worlde live rightly ad holilie.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>But this he confuteth in that booke at  
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>large &amp; that substantially. So then,

      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>true faith which bedeth on God alone  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>and is directed by the worde of God, is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>formal enough or susficiently in fashis,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>Verily the forme of faith is ingraven 
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>in the heart ofthe faithtull, by the holy  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>Ghost. And although it bee small and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>doth not grow up to the highest degree, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>yet notwithstanding, it is true fayth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>having force in it as it were a grayne  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>of mustardseede.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>The theefe that was crucified with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>our Lorde, beleeved in the Lord Jesus,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>and was saved, although the force of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>faith was strong in him but a verye  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>small season, and brought not forth a 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>ny great store of fruite of good workes:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>finally, that faith of the theefe was not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>any whit divers or contrarie from the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>faith of saint Peter and sint Paul,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>but was altogether ye very same with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>theirs, although their faith brought  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>forth somwhat more aboundantly the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>fruite of good workes. Peter and Paul 
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>were frankly and freely justified, al 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>though they had manye good workes:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>freely was the theef justified, although  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>his good works were very few or none  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>at all. Let us hold therefore, that true  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>faith is one alone, which notwithstan 
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>ding doth increase &amp; is augmented, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>again, may decrease &amp; be ertinguished.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>There remaineth now for mee to de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>clare, the vertue &amp; effect of true faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>This hath the holy Apostle Paul done  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>very excellently well, yea and that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>most absolutely too. But although in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>the eleventh chapter to the Hebrewes 
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>he had saide very much, he is conspel 
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>led notwithstanding to confesse that he  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>cannot reckon up all: therefore at this

      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>beloved) to bee sought out &amp; confidered  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>of your selves.

      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>knowe God, and judge aright of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>judgementes and woorkes of God, of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>vertues and vices. The wisedome that  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>it bringeth with it, is without doubt ye  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>true wisedome. Many men hope that  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>they can attaine to true wisedome by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>the ftudie of Philosophie: but they are  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>deceived as farre as heaven is broade.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>For Philosophie doth falsly judge, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>faultily teach many thinges touching  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>God, the workes of GOD, the chiefe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>goodnesse, the ende of good and evil, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>touthing thinges to bee desired and es 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>chewed. But the verie same thinges  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>are rightly and truely taught in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>word of God, and understoode and per 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ceived by faith. Faith therefore is the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>true wisedome, and maketh us wise in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>deede. For Jereme also saith. Beholde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>they have cast away the worde of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Lorde, what wisedome therefore can 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>there be left in them? The wisedome  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>of salomon, is worshipfully thought  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>of throughout the whole compasse of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>the world. And yet we reade that the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>Lord in the Gospell after S. Math, ut 
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>tered this sentence against the Jewes.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>The Egeene of the South shall rise in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>judgement with this generation and 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>shall condemne it, because shee came  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>from the endes of the worlde to heare  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>the wisedome of salomon: et beholde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>there is one in this place greater than 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>Salomon. Christ is preferred before  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>Salomon, and the wisedome of Christ  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>before the wisedome of salomon. But  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>it is well knowne that the wisedom of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>Christ the sonne of God can not bee at 
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>teyned too without faith. Faith there 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>fore bringeth with it the most ercellet  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>wisedom. But herein, this wisedom of

      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>not in thy heart who shal descend into

      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>from above. Or who shall descend in

      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>from the dead againe. But what saith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>he) The worde is nigh unto thee even 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>in thy heart: this same is the worde of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>faith which we preach, for if thou co

      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>and doest beleeve with thy heart that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>God hath raised him from the dead 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>thou shalt be saved. Faith therefore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>doth not onely make us wise but hap

      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>nes thereunto &amp; saying to his disciples.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>Nappie are the eyes that see the things

      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>nes, so ye he in us &amp; we in him may live,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>&amp; faith doth also fully justifie us. But  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>now it is best to heare the testimonies  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>out of the scriptures. Faith maketh us  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>happy. For to S. Pet, confessing ye lord  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>Jesus by true faith it is sayde. Bappie 
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>art thou simon the son of Jonas. Vlesh  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>and bloud hath not revealed this to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>thee, but my father which is in heave.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>S. Paul for the proofe of faith bringeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>in that sentence of David. Happi are  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>they whose iniduities are forgiven and 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>whose sinnes are covered. Plessed is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>the man to who the Lord shall impute  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>no sinne. Faith dquickneth or maketh a  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>live. For the just liveth by faith. This  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>doth Paule very often in his writings  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>alledge out of the prophets. The same  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Paul also saith: The life which nowI 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>live in flesh, I live by faith in the sonne  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>of God, who lovedmee and gave him  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>selfe for me. Faith ioineth us to ye eter 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>nall &amp; chiefe goodnes, &amp; so maketh us to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>inioy ye chief goodnes, ye god may dwell  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>in us &amp; we in God. For the Lord Jesus  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>himselfe in the gospell saith. He which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>eateth my flesh, &amp;t drinketh my bloud  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>dwelleth in me, et I in him. As the ly

      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>me. But to eate &amp; drinkye Lord is to be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>lieve in ye Lord, ye he hath given himself  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>to death for us. Wherupon Johnye A

      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>ment or to the sentence of condemna
