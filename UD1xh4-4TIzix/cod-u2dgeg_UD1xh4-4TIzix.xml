      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>Of true faith, fromwhence it commeth, that it is an  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>assured beleefe of the minde, whose onely stay

      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>In my last sermon 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>I declared unto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>you, how that the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>perfect exposition of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/> Gods worde doth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>differ nothing from 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>y rule of true faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>and the love of God and our neigh 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>bour. For undoubtedly, that sense of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>Scripture is corrupted, which doth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>square from faith, and the two poynts  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>of charitie. I have nowe therefore next 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>to treat of true faith and charitie to 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>wards God and our neighbour, to the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>intent that no man may finde lacke of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>any thing heerein. 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>And first therefore by Gods helpe, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>the good meanes of your prayers, I wil  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>speake of true faith.  
   </p>
   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>This word Faith or beleefe, is di 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>versly used in the common talk of me 
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>For it is taken for any kinde of Reli 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>gion or honour done to God. As we say 
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/><quote>the Christian faith, the Jewish faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>and the Turkish faith</quote>. Faith or beleefe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>also, is taken for a conceived opinion of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>any thing that is told us, as when we  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>heare any thing rehearsed unto us out  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>of the Indian or Ethiopian hystorie,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>we by and by say that wee beleeve it,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>and yet notwithstanding wee put no  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>confidence in it nor hope to have any  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>commoditie thereby at all. <quote>This is that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>faith, wherewith saint <name>James</name> sayeth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>that the Devil beleeveth ec trembleth</quote>. 
   </p>
   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>Last of all, faith is commonly put for  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>an allured and undoubted confidence  
      <!--30.xml-->
      <cb ed="#L" n="c"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>in God and his word. Among the He 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>brues faith taketh her name of truth,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>certeintie and allured constancie. The  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>Latines call that faith, when that is,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>done which is said. Whereuppon one  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>saith, <quote>I demaunde of thee whether 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>thou beleevest or no?</quote> Thou aunswe 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>rest, <quote>I beleeve: Doe then that which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>thou saiest, and it is faith</quote>. Therefore in :  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>this treatise of ours, <quote>Faith is an un 
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>doubted beleefe, most firmely groun 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>ded in the minde</quote>. This faith, which is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>a settled and undoubted perswasion or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>beleefe leaning upon God &amp; his word,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>is diversly defined by ye perfecter Di 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>vines. S. <name>Paul</name> saith, <quote>Faith is the sub 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>stance of thinges hoped for, the evi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>dence of thinges not seene</quote>. The sub 
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>stance or hypostasis is the foundation.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>or the unmoveable prop, which uphol 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>deth us, &amp; wheron we leane &amp; lye with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>out peril or danger. The things hoped  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>for, are thinges celestiall, eternall, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>inuisible. And therefore <name>Paul</name> sayeth.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/><quote>Faith is an unmoveable foundation,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>and a most allured confidence of gods 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>promises, that is, of life everlasting and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>all his good benefits</quote>. Moreover <name>Paul</name>  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>himelfe, making an erposition of that  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>which he had spoken, immediately af,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>ter, saith: <quote>Faith is the argument of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>thinges not seene</quote>. An argument or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>proofe is an evident demoustration,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>wherby we manifestly prove ye, which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>otherwise should he doubtful, so that in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>him whom we undertooke to instruct,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>there may remaine no doubt at all.  
      <!--31.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="31"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>But now touthing ye mysteries of god 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>revealed in Gods word, in theselves  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>or in their owne nature they can not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>be seene with bodilie eyes : and there 
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>fore are called thinges not seene. But,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>this faith by giving light to the minde,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>dooth in heart perceive them, even as  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>they are set foorth in the word of God.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/><quote>Faith therefore according to the de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>sinition of <name>Paul</name>, is in the minde a most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>evident saying, and in the heart a most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>certaine perceiving of thinges invisi 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>ble, that is, of thinges eternall, of God 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>I say and all those thinges which hee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>in his word setteth forth unto us con 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>cerning spirituall thinges</quote>. To this de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>finition of <name>Paules</name> they had an eye,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>which defined Faith in this forte.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/><quote>Faith is a grounded persuasion of hea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>venly thinges, in the meditation wher 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>of wee ought so to oecupie our selves 
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>for the allured truthes sake of Gods 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>worde, thatwe may beleeve that in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>minde we doe see those things as well  
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>as with our eyes we do behold things 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>sensibly perceived, &amp; easie to be seene</quote>. 
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>This description doth not greatly dif 
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>fer from this definition of an other 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>godly &amp; learned man who saith: <quote>Faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>is a stedfast perswasion of the minde, 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>whereby we doe fully decree with our  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>selves that gods truth is so sure, that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>he can neither will nor choose but 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>performe that which he in his worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>hath promised to fulsill. Againe, Faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>is a stedfast allurednesse of conscience,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>which dooth imbrace Christ in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>same fort, wherein he is offered unto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>us by the Gospell</quote>. Another there is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>which after the same manner almost  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>defineth faith in this forte: <quote>Faith is a  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>gift inspired by God into the mind of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>man, wherby without any doubting at  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>all he doth beleeve that to bee most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>true what so ever God hath either  
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>taught or promised in the bookes of  
      <!--31.xml-->
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>both the Testaments</quote>. The very same  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>author of this definition therfore doth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>ertend faith to three termes of time, to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>the time past, the time present, and the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>time to come: For he teacheth to be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>lieve that the world was made by god,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>and whatsoever the holy Scriptures  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>doe declare to have beene done in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>olde world: also that Christ dying for  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>us, is the only salvation of them which I 
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>believe: and that by the same God at  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>this day also, the world and Church  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>are governed or preserved, aud that in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>Christ the faithfull are saved : last of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>all, that that shall most alluredly light  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>upon the ungodly and ye godly, whatso 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>ever the holy Scriptures doe either  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>threaten or promise.  
   </p>
   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>Out of all these definitions therfore  
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>being diligently considered, wee maye  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>according to ye Scriptures make this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>description of faith. <quote>Faith is a gift of 
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>God, powred into man from heaven,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>whereby he is taught with an undou 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>ted perswasion, wholie to leane to 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>God and his worde, in which worde  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>God doth freely promise life and all 
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>good thinges in Christ, and wherein 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>all truth necessarie to be beleeved, is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>plainly declared</quote>. Which description 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>of faith, I will by Gods helpe in this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>that followeth unfolde into parts, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>by assertion of places out of the Scrip 
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>tures, will both confirme and make  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>manifest unto you, Yee, as hitherto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>ye have done, so stil give diligent eare,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>and in your heartes pray earnestly to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>God.  
   </p>
   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>Frst of al, the cause or beginning of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>faith commeth not of any man, or any  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>strength of man, but of God himelfe,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>who by his holy spirite, inspireth faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>into our heartes. For in the Gospell  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>the Lord saith, <quote>No man commeth to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>me, unlesse my father draw him</quote>. 
   </p>
   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>And againe, Fleshe and bloude  
      <!--32.xml-->
      <pb ed="#L" n="32"/>
      <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>saith the Lord to <name>Peter</name>, confessinge  
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>Christ in true faith) <quote>hath not revealed  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>this to thee, but my father which is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>in heaven</quote>. Whereunto the Apostle  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/><name>Paul</name> alludeth when he sayth, <quote>we are  
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>not able of our selves to thinke any 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>thing as of our selves, but all our abili 
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>tie is of God</quote>. And in an other place, <quote>To  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>you it is given for Christ, not onely to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>beleeve in him, but also to suffer for  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>his sake</quote>. Faith therefore is powred in 
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>to our hearts by God, who is the wel 
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>spring and cause of all goodnesse.  
   </p>
   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>And yet we have to consider heere,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>that God in giving &amp; inspiring faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>dooth not use his absolute polver, or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>miracles in working, but a certaine  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ordinarie meanes agreeable to mans  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>capacitie: although he can in deede give 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>faith without those meanes, to whom,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>when, and how it pleaseth him? But  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>we read, that the Lord hath used this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>ordinarie meanes, even from the first  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>creation of all things. Whom he mea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>neth to bestowe knowledge and fayth  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>on: to them he sendeth teachers, by the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>word of God to preach true faith unto  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>them. Not because it lieth in mans 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>polver, wil, or ministerie, to give faith,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>nor because the outward word spoken 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>by mans mouth, is able of it selfe to  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>bring faith: but the voyce of man, and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>the preaching of Gods word, doo teach  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>us what true faith is, or what God 
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>dooth wil and commaund us to believe.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>For God himselfe alone by sending his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>holy spirite into the hearts and minds 
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>of men, dooth open our heartes, per 
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>swade our mindes, and cause us with  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>all our heart to believe that, which we  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>by his word and teaching have learned  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>to believe.  
   </p>
   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>The Lord coulde by miracle from  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>heaven, without any preaching at all,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>have bestowed faith in Christ upon 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/><name>Cornelius the Centurion</name> at Cesaria: 
      <!--32.xml-->

      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>but yet by an Angel he dooth send him 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>to the preaching of <name>Peter</name>. And while.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/><name>Peter</name> preacheth, God by his holy spis

   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>But, even as the Lorde his desire is,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>to have us believe his worde, (for the

      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>if yee will heare his voice, harden not

      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>require of us al which heare his word,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>that we be not slacke in praying. For  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>in hearing the worde of God, we must  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>pray for the gift of faith, that the Lord  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>may open our harts, covert our soules,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>breake and beate downe the hardnesse  
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>of our mindes, and increase the mea 
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>sure of faith bestowed uppon us. Of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>this order of prayer, there are many  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>examples in the holy scriptures. Whe  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>the Lorde in the Gospell sayde to one,

      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>prayer, wherin we desire to have faith  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>powred into us, is of the grace and gift  
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>of GOD, and not of our owne righte

      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>gift of God, which is by the holy ghost  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>from heaven, bestowed uppon our 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>mindes, and is declared unto us in the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>worde of trueth, by teachers sent of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>God, and is obtained by earnest prai

      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>we learne that wee ought often and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>attentively to heare the word of God,

   <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>But that this faith inspired from

      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>heart is made privie, that is, that true  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Faith doeth not flye too and fro from 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>place to place in the heart of man, but 
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>that beeing deepely rooted in Christ, it  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>sticketh in the hart which is enlighte 
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>ned.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>First, saieth the Apostle,<quote> <name>Abraham</name> 
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>contrarie to hope, beleeved in hope</quote>:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>that is to say, there he had a constant  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>hope, where notwithstanding hee had 
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>nothing to hope after, if all things had 
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>beene weighed according to the maner 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>of this worlde. But Hope is a most  
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>firm and undoubted looking after those  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>thinges which we believe: So that we  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>see that the Apostle did make faith ma 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>nifest by hope, and by the certaine 
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>tie of hope, did declare the allured con 
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>stancie of faith. After that saith he,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/><quote><name>Abraham</name> fainted not in faith, nor 
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>stackered at the promise of God tho 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>rouoh unbeliefe, but was stronge in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>faith.</quote>  
    </p>
    <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>Ther are two kinds of ftackerings  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>in mankinde: The one is that which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>being overcome by evill temptations,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>doth bende to desperation, and the de 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>spising of Gods promises. Such was 
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>the stackering of those ten spies of the  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>holy lande, of whom mention is made  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>in the thirteen and fourteene chapter of  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>Numbers.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>The other stackering, is rather to be  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>called a weak infirmity of faith, which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>also is tempted it selfe : that nowe I  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>may not make rehearsall to you, how  
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>that in us all by the spot of originall  
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>sin, is naturally grafted a certain kind  
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>of unbeliefe, and that mans minde is  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>at no time so inlightened or confir 
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>med, but that cloudie mystes of igno 
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>raunce and doubtinges doe sometimes  
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>arise: yet notwithstanding, faith yeel 
       <!--34.xml-->
      <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
      <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>deth not to tentation, neither is drow 
      <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>ned nor sticketh in the mire of stacke 
      <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>ring, but laying hold upon the promised  
      <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>worde of truth, getteth up againe by  
      <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>strugling, and is confirmed. So wee 
      <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>reade, that at the promise of God, this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>came into <name>Abrahams</name> minde. What,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>shall there a Sonne bee borne to thee  
      <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>that art an hunored yeares olde: This  
      <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>was that infirmitie, and stackering or  
      <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>weaknes of faith. But here thr Apostle  
      <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>commending <name>Abrahams</name> faith, which  
      <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>overcame and yeelded not, teaching us  
      <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>also of what fort true faith ought to be,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>that is, a firme and most allured per 
      <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>swasion, saith: <quote><name>Abraham</name> fainted not 
      <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>in faith, neither considered his owne  
      <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>bodie dead, when hee was almost an  
      <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>hundred yeares olde, nor the dead 
      <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>nesse of <name>Saraes</name> wombe.</quote> Loe, this  
      <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>thought came into <name>Abrahams</name> minde.  
      <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Shal a sonne be borne to mee that am  
      <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>an hundred yeares old: But he fainted  
      <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>not in faith. The faith of <name>Abraham</name> be 
      <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>gan not to droope by reason of this tep 
      <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>tation.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>For, he considered not the weaknes  
      <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>that was in himself, nothing answera 
      <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>ble to the promise of God. What then 
      <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>He stackered not at the promise of God 
      <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>through unbeliefe. That is, he gave no 
      <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>place to unbeliefe to be tempted of it:  
      <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>he fell not to his owne reasons and  
      <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>doubtfull inquisitions, as unbelievers  
      <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>are wont to doe For Gods promise  
      <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>being once set before the eyes of his  
      <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>mind, so that I say he stucke unmove 
      <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>ably, casting off all doubts and reasons  
      <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>of his owne. For, faith hath no re 
      <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>spect at all to the weakenesse, mise 
      <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>rie, or lacke which is properly in man 
      <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>kinde, but setteth her whole staye in  
      <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>the polver of God. So then, I saye,  
      <lb ed="#L" n="44"/><name>Abraham</name> was strong in faith, that 
      <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>is, he prevayled and gotte the upper 
      <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>hande in his temptation. For, this

       <pb ed="#L" n="35"/>
       <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
       <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>is an argument to shewe that hee had 
       <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>the upper hande: <quote>He fainted not, nor 
       <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>wated meake in faith.</quote> It followeth  
       <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>in the Apostle, <quote>Abraham gave GOD 
       <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>the glorie</quote>, to witte, in beleeving that  
       <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>GOD wisheth well to mankinde  
       <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>and that hee is a true God and almigh 
       <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>tie.  
    </p>
    <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>For he giveth God his glory, which  
       <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>attributeth to God the properties of

       <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>saith: <quote>He that beleeveth not in God, 
       <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>maketh God a lyar, <name>Abraham</name> there

       <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>which is all one as if you should saye,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>beeing certified. For, <foreign>wwerderis</foreign> doeth  
       <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>signifie fully to certifie : whereupon 
       <lb ed="#L" n="25"/><foreign>Thnes tris</foreign> is an allured faith given un 
       <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>to us which is made by waye of ar

       <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>they call that <foreign>wnreemus</foreign>, which we call  
       <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>a certification, as when a thing by

       <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>that after that we never doubt anye  
       <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>more.  
    </p>
    <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Therefore faith did certifie <name>Abraham</name>, 
       <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>and with undoubted perswasions did  
       <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>bring him to the point never to doubt,

       <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>in the expresse worde of God. There 
       <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>by also we learne, that faith is not the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>unstable and unaduised confidence of  
       <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>him which believeth every greate and  
       <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>unpossible thing. For, faith is ruled &amp; 
       <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>bound to the word of God, to the word  
       <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>of God, I say, rightly and truly under 
       <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>stoode.  
    </p>
    <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>The godly and faithfull therefore,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>doe not by and by, out of the omnipo

       <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>as though God therfore would do eve 
       <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>ry thing beeause he ean do all thinges,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>or that faith should therefore believe  
       <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>every thing, because it is written: <quote>All  
       <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>thinges are possible to him that belee 
       <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>veth.</quote> For, his faith is therefore a  
       <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>greate deale more, because that which  
       <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>hee doth beleeve, is so set downe and  
       <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>declared in the word of God, as he do 
       <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>eth believe.

       <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>Furthermore, where the Lorde in

       <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>not take that saying to bee absolutely  
       <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>spoken, but to be joyned to the worde,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>will, and glory of God, &amp; the safetie of  
       <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>our soules. For, all thinges which  
       <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>GOD in his worde hath promised)  
       <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>all thinges whiche GOD. will

       <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>garde of our soules, are possible to him 
       <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>that beleeveth. And for that cause,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>the Apostle both openly and plainely  
       <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>saide: w<quote>hatsoever God hath promi

       <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>was sorely plagved with the bloudye

       <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>minated, we may thereby understand,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>because she (being first in deede stirred  
       <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>up by the works &amp; words of the Lord)  
       <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>thought thus within her selfe, if Idoe

       <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>man, declare more plainly than that it  
       <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>can be denied, how that faith is a most  
       <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>allured perswasion of things believed:  
       <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>For being over passed, and as it were

       <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>not in faith, but following him, &amp; hea 
       <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>ring also that the Lord was sent to the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>lost sheepe of the house of Israel, shee  
       <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>goeth on to woorship him. Moreover,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>being put backe, &amp; as it were touched  
       <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>with the foule reproch of a dogge, shee

       <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>sting to obtaine the thing that she desi 
       <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>red. She would not have persevered so  
       <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>stiffely if faith had not beene a certifi

    <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>It is manifest therefore, by all these

       <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>faith is a stedfast &amp; undouted persuasio  
       <!--37.xml-->
       <pb ed="#L" n="37"/>
       <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
       <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>in the minde and heart of the believer.

    <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>This, being now brought to an end,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>let us see what it is whereupon mans  
       <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>faith doth leane, and also how we may 
       <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>clearely perceive, that faith is not a  
       <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>vayne and unstable opinion (as a litle  
       <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>before wee were about to saye) of any  
       <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>thinge whatsoever conceived in the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>minde of man, but that it is tyed by  
       <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>and contayned within bounds, and as  
       <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>it were certaine conditions. In the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>definition therefore of faith, we sayde  
       <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>that faith bendeth to Godwarde, and  
       <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>leaneth on his worde. God therefore  
       <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>and the worde of God, is the object  
       <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>or foundation of true faith. The thing 
       <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>whereon a man may leane safely, sure 
       <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ly, and without all manner doubting,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>must needes be stedfast and altogether 
       <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>unmoveable, which doeth give health,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>which doth preserue, and which doth fil  
       <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>up or minister all fulnes unto us.  
    </p>
    <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>For this doth faith seeke and request,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>But this is not else where tha in God.  
       <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>On God, alone therefore doeth true  
       <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>faith bende and leane. God is everla 
       <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>sting, chifely good, wise, just, mightie  
       <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>and true of worde. And that doeth he  
       <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>testifie by his workes and word,  
     </p>
     <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>Wherefore in the Prophets he is cal 
       <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>led a strong and unmoveable Rocke,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>a castle, a wall, a tower, an invincible  
       <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>fortresse, a treasure, &amp; a wel that never 
       <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>will be drawen drie. This everlasting  
       <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>GOD can do all thinges, knoweth all  
       <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>thinges, is present in all places, loveth  
       <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>mankind exceedingly, doth provide for  
       <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>al men, and also governeth or disposeth  
       <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>al things. Faith therefore, which is a  
       <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>confidence of Gods good will and of his  
       <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>aide in al necessities, &amp; of the true sal 
       <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>vation of mantinde, bendeth on god a

     </p>
     <p>
       <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>And even as God is true of word, &amp;  
       <!--37.xml-->
       <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
       <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>can not lye, so is his word true and de 
       <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>ceiveth no man. In the worde of  
       <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>God is expressed the will and minde  
       <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>of God: To the word of God therefore

       <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ble. Therefore it it be easier for these  
       <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>thinges to be loased, which cannot be  
       <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>undone, than for the worde of God to  
       <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>passe: it followeth that Gods word in  
       <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>al pointes is most stable, unmonea

       <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>cannot choose but bee an undoubted

       <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>of faith, which we in the definition of  
       <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>faith have closely knit up together 
       <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Ther are there rehearsed two chiefe  
       <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>pointes of faith and of the worde. And  
       <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>first of all that God in Christ doth free 
       <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>ly promise life and every good thing.  
       <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>For God, who is the obiect or marke  
       <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>and foundation of faith, being of his  
       <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>owne proper nature everliving ever 
       <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>lasting, &amp; good, doth of himself from be 
       <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>fore all beginning, beget the son like to  
       <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>himselfe in al points, who because he is  
       <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>of the same substance with the father, 
       <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>is himselfe also by nature life and all  
       <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>goodnesse.  And to the ende he might 
       <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>communicate to us, his Sonnes and  
       <!--38.xml-->
       <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
       <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>brethren, both life and all goodnesse, he  
       <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>became man, and being conversant ve 
       <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>rie God and man among men, he testi 
       <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>fied that God the Father, through the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Sonne, doeth powre himselfe wholy  
       <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>with all good thinges into the faithtul,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>whom hee quickneth and filleth with  
       <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>all goodnesse, and last of all doth take  
       <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>them uppe to himelfe into the bles 
       <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>sed place of everlasting life.  And that  
       <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>hee doth frankly and freely bestow this  
       <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>benefite, to the ende that the glorie of  
       <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>his grace may in all thinges be pray 
       <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>sed. This doth true faith believe, and  
       <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>hereunto belong no small parte of the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>Scriptures, which testifie that God in  
       <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>Christ doth communicate to the faith,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>full, life and godlines. <name>John the Apo 
       <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>stle</name> cryeth out and saith: <quote>In the be 
       <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>ginning was the word, and the worde  
       <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>was with God, &amp; God was the worde,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>And the worde becam flesh, &amp; dwelt 
       <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>among us. And we sawe the glorie of  
       <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>God as the glorie of the onely begot 
       <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>ten sonne of the Father, full of grace  
       <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>and trueth. And of his fulnes have all  
       <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>we received, &amp;c.</quote> For the Lorde him 
       <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>selfe in the Gospell after <name>Saint John</name>,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>sayde: <quote>Verily l say unto you, whatso 
       <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>ever thinges the father doth, the same  
       <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>also doeth the sonne. For even as the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>Father doth raise the dead to life and  
       <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>quickneth them, so also doth the sonne  
       <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>quicken whom he will: for, neyther 
       <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>judgeth the father any man, but hath  
       <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>committed all judgment to the sonne,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>that all men may honour the sonne  
       <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>even as they honour the Father. Hee  
       <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>that honoureth not the sonne, the 
       <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>same honoureth not the father which  
       <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>hath sent him. Verily verily l say un 
       <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>to you, he that heareth my worde, and  
       <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>beleeveth on him that sent mee, hath  
       <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>life everlasting, and shall not come in 
       <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>to judgement, but is escaped from  
       <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>death uuto life.</quote>

       <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>ry good thing doth freely come to it from  
       <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>God through Christ: which is the

       <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>cessary to bee beleeved : and that true  
       <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>faith doth believe all that is declared  
       <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>in the Scriptures For, it telleth us  
       <lb ed="#L" n="37"/><quote>that God is, what manner one hee is,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>what Gods workes are, what his judgments,

       <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>his promises, &amp; what his threatninges

       <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>are necessarie to bee beleeved, that 
       <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>doth Gods word wholly set down un 
       <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>to us, &amp; that doeth true faith receyve,

       <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>beleeving all thinges that are written 
       <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>in the Lawe and the Prophetes, in the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>Gospell and writings of the Apostles.</quote>  
       <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>But, whatsoever can not be fetched or  
       <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>proved out of these writings or what 
       <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>soever is contrarie unto them, that do  
       <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>the faithfull not believe at all. For,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>the very nature of true faith is, not to  
       <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>beleve that which squareth from the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>worde of God. Whosoever therefore  
       <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>believeth not the fables and opinions  
       <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>of me, hee alone beleeveth as he should:  
       <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>for he dependeth onely upon the worde  
       <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>of God, and so upon God himelfe, the  
       <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>onely fountaine of al trueth. The mat 
       <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>ter, the argument, and the whole sum 
       <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>of faith, is briefly set out unto us in  
       <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>the Articles of the Christian faith :  
       <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>whereof I wil speake at another time,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>I have this houre declared unto you  
       <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>(doerely beloved, and reverend brethre  
       <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>in the Lorde) the definition of faith,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>which to the end that I may surely fa 
       <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>sten in every ones minde, and that all  
       <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>may understande what faith is, I re 
       <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>peate it here againe, and therewithall  
       <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>conclude this Sermon. Faith is a gifte  
       <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>of God, powred into man from Hea 
       <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>ven, whereby hee is taught with an un 
       <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>doubted perswasion wholly to leane 
       <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>to God &amp; his worde, in which worde,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>God in Christ doth freely promise life  
       <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>and every good thing, &amp; wherein all  
       <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>trueth necessary to be beleved is plain 
       <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>ly declared. Let us al pray to God our  
       <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>father through his onely begotte sonne 
       <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>our Lorde Jesus Christ, that hee will  
       <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>vouchsafe from Heaven, to bestowe  
       <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>true faith upon us all, that we  
       <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>by it knowng him aright,  
       <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>may at the last obteine  
       <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>life everlasting.  
       <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>Amen.
